\section{Figures}
The examples on this and following pages should help you get a feel
for how screen-shots and other figures should be placed in the
template. Your document may use color figures (see
Figures~\ref{fig:sample}), which are included in the page limit; the
figures must be usable when printed in black and white. You can use
the \texttt{\marginpar} command to insert figures in the (left) margin
of the document (see Figure~\ref{fig:marginfig}). Finally, be sure to
make images large enough so the important details are legible and
clear (see Figure~\ref{fig:cats}).
