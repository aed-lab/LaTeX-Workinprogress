\section{Producing and Testing PDF Files}
We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well
before the final deadline. Your PDF file must be ACM DL Compliant and
meet stated requirements,
\url{http://www.sheridanprinting.com/sigchi/ACM-SIG-distilling-settings.htm}.

\marginpar{\vspace{-23pc}So long as you don't type outside the right
  margin or bleed into the gutter, it's okay to put annotations over
  here on the left, too; this annotation is near Hawaii. You'll have
  to manually align the margin paragraphs to your \LaTeX\ floats using
  the \texttt{{\textbackslash}vspace{}} command.}

\begin{margintable}[1pc]
  \begin{minipage}{\marginparwidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{r r l}
      & {\small \textbf{First}}
      & {\small \textbf{Location}} \\
      \toprule
      Child & 22.5 & Melbourne \\
      Adult & 22.0 & Bogot\'a \\
      \midrule
      Gene & 22.0 & Palo Alto \\
      John & 34.5 & Minneapolis \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{A simple narrow table in the left margin
      space.}~\label{tab:table2}
  \end{minipage}
\end{margintable}
Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we
will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 10. This is
widely available at no cost. Note that most
reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat
reader, so please check your PDF accordingly.
